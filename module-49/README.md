# 1. Understanding Anomalies

### Anomalies

Anomalies is databases refer to inconsistencies or unexpected issues that can occur during data manipulation or retrieval.

There are three main types of anomalies:

- Update anomalies
- Delete anomalies
- Insert anomalies

# 2. Understanding Functional Dependency.

### Normalization

- Functional Dependency
- Normal Forms

### Functional Dependency

Functional dependency is simple terms means that the value of one attribute (or set of attributes) uniquely determines the value of another attribute(s) in a database table.
